            <h3>Simple and tastful curry that will melt in your mouth.</h3>
                <p>It's not your traditional curry. It won't overwhelm you with spices.</p>
                <p>This is Korean Curry, often served with rice. A simple, yet delicious mix of potatoes, onions, and carrots.</p>
                <p>My mouth waters just thinking about it.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 pound pork loin (or beef or chicken)</li>
                <li>2 medium potatoes (about 10-12oz), peeled and cut into 3/4 inch cubes</li>
                <li>1 large onion (about 8oz) cut into 3/4 inch cubes</li>
                <li>1 medium carrot (about 3oz), peeled and cut into 1/4 inch cubes</li>

            <ol>
