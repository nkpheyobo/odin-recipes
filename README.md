# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin project. I will be building a basic recipe website using HTML skills I have learned so far. I will be using HTML elements, tags, text, lists, links, images, and learning how to use commit messages properly throughout this project. Afterwards, I will reflect on what I did, how I used my knowledge, and what I've learned.
